# iris-Dataset-classification-using-random-forest-algorithm
This repository is about a iris dataset classification project using random forest algorithm.

Dataset used = iris dataset

Algorithm used = Random Forest Algorithm

This Random Forest Algorithm is used to classify iris plants into their 3 subtypes:
    1) Versicolor
    2) setosa
    3) virginica
    
The dataset has 150 rows with 5 columns:
    1) Sepal Length (cm): Length of the Sepal
    2) Sepal Width (cm): Width of the Sepal
    3) Petal Length (cm): Length of the Petal
    4) Petal Width (cm): Width of the Petal
    5) Target: 0 if the plant is a setosa
               1 if the plant is a versicolor
               2 if the plant is a virginica
               
The code divides the dataset into Training and Test set.
The training set has 80% of the data
The test set has the 20% of the data

The model has a r2 score of 96.67%(approximately)

The Repository contains both the code and the model
